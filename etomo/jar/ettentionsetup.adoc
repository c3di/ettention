[Field = CommandFile]
short = co
type = FN
usage = Command file for reconstruction (with or without extension)
tooltip =
manpage = Command file for reconstruction, which can be entered with or
without its extension of ".com".  If this option is not entered, a non-option
argument is used for the command file.

[Field = Lambda]
short = l
type = FP
usage = Relaxation parameter for iterative methods
tooltip = Relaxation parameter for back projection step - the value should be set
according to the noise level in input projections between 0.001 (high noise level)
and 2.0 (very low noise level).
manpage = Use this option to specify the relaxation parameter for back projection step.
The value should be set according to the noise level in input projections between 0.001
(high noise level) and 2.0 (very low noise level). Influences the convergence speed - 
lower values require more iterations to converge.

[Field = NumberOfIterations]
short = ni
type = I
usage = Number of iterations to run.
tooltip = Number of iterations to run.
manpage = Number of iterations to run.

[Field = NumberOfProjections]
short = np
type = I
usage = Set the number of projections to be processed before volume update in 
OS-SIRT method.
tooltip = Specify the number of projections for volume update.Needs to be set
if Ordered Subset SIRT (OS-SIRT) method is used for reconstruction.
manpage = Set the number of projections to be processed before volume update
in OS-SIRT method. The value should be between 1 and the complete number of input
projections.

[Field = OversamplingForwardProjection]
short = of
type = I
usage = Oversampling for forward projection step. Default is 1 for no oversampling
tooltip = Use oversampling in forward projection step to improve the quality of 
reconstruction. Slows down reconstruction process. Default is 1 for no oversampling.
manpage = Use oversampling in forward projection step to improve the quality of 
reconstruction. Slows down reconstruction process. Default is 1 for no oversampling.

[Field = OversamplingBackProjection]
short = ob
type = I
usage = Oversampling for back projection step. Default is 1 for no oversampling
tooltip = Use oversampling in back projection step to improve the quality of 
reconstruction. Slows down reconstruction process. Default is 1 for no oversampling.
manpage = Use oversampling in back projection step to improve the quality of 
reconstruction. Slows down reconstruction process. Default is 1 for no oversampling.  

[Field = UseLongObjectCompensation]
short = loc
type = B
usage = Use long object compensation in the reconstruction to remove vignetting
artifacts on the edges caused by the scanned sample being larger than reconstructed
area.
tooltip = Use if the scanned sample is larger than reconstructed area.
manpage = Use long object compensation in the reconstruction to remove vignetting
artifacts on the edges caused by the scanned sample being larger than reconstructed
area.

[Field = ReconstructionType]
short = rt
type = FN
usage = Specify the reconstruction method.
tooltip = Specify the reconstruction method. The options are SART, SIRT and OS-SIRT.
manpage = Specify the reconstruction method. The options are SART, SIRT and OS-SIRT. 
Use SART method for reconstruction to update the volume after each projection. Use 
SIRT method for reconstruction to update the volume after all projections. Use OS-SIRT
(Ordered Subset SIRT) method for reconstruction to update the volume after specified
number of projections.
